### Notes
<sup>1</sup> To use Shelly 2 or Shelly 2.5 in roller shutter mode the device
must have been calibrated and be running firmware version 1.4.9 or later.

<sup>2</sup> Requires firmware version 1.5.1 or later.

## Installation
1. Install homebridge by following
   [the instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge#installation).
2. Install this plugin by running `npm install -g homebridge-shelly`.
3. Add the configuration to your homebridge config.json.

## Configuration
In most cases, simply adding this plugin to the homebridge config.json will be
enough:
```json
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Shelly",
    "name": "Shelly"
  }
]
```
Your Shelly devices will then be automatically discovered, as long as they are
on the same network and subnet as the device running homebridge.

To see a list of all discovered devices, visit the administration page by going
to `http://<IP-ADDRESS>:<PORT>/`, where IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the
device that you are running homebridge on, and PORT is the configured port
number (8080 by default, see below).

### Network interface
Sometimes setting the `"networkInterface"` option to the local IP address of
your device will help when your devices aren't automatically discovered, or
you see error messages like `addMembership EADDRNOTAVAIL` or
`addMembership EADDRINUSE`.

### Authentication
Set the `"username"` and `"password"` options if you have restricted the web
interface with a username and password. Note that this configuration applies
to all Shelly devices.

### Request timeout
The `"requestTimeout"` option can be used to configure the timeout for HTTP
requests to the Shelly devices. Specify in milliseconds. Default is 10 seconds.

### Stale timeout
Use the `"staleTimeout"` option to configure how long a device can be offline
before it is regarded as stale and unregistered from HomeKit. Specify in
milliseconds. Set to `0` or `false` to disable. Disabled by default.

### Administration interface
By default, this plugin will launch an HTTP server on port 8080 to serve an
administration interface. You can disable this by setting `"admin"."enabled"`
to `false`. You can also change the port number using `"admin"."port"`.

### Device specific configurations
Configurations for specific Shelly devices can be set using the `"devices"`
array. Each object in the array must contain an `"id"` property with the ID of
the Shelly device that you want to target. IDs are always made up of 6
hexadecimal characters and can be found in the Shelly Cloud app or the web
interface of a device, under *Settings -> Device info -> Device ID*.

#### General configurations
* `"exclude"` - set to `true` to exclude the device from Homebridge.
* `"username"` and `"password"` - set these if you have restricted the web
  interface of the device with a username and password. This will override the
  global `"username"` and `"password"` options.

#### Shelly RGBW2 configurations
* `"colorMode"` - set to `"rgbw"` (default) to have HomeKit control all four
  channels of the device (R, G, B, and W), or to `"rgb"` to omit the W channel.

### Example configuration
```json
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Shelly",
    "name": "Shelly",
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "pa$$word",
    "devices": [
      { "id": "74B5A3", "exclude": true },
      { "id": "A612F0", "username": "admin", "password": "pa$$word2" },
      { "id": "6A78BB", "colorMode": "rgb" }
    ],
    "admin": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 8181
    }
  }
]
```

## Unsupported devices
If you have a Shelly device that is not yet supported by this plugin you can
help adding support for it by following these steps:

1. Run `$ homebridge-shelly describe <ip-address>` with the IP address of the
   Shelly device.
2. Create [a new issue](https://github.com/alexryd/homebridge-shelly/issues)
   and post the output from the previous command.

## Donations
I develop this plugin in my spare time. If you like it and you find it useful,
please consider donating a small amount by clicking the button below. That will
allow me to buy new Shelly devices so that I can add support for them.
